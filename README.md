# Project Euler

The scope of this repository is to collect the solutions to the [Project Euler Problems](https://projecteuler.net/about). 

I would always try to solve them using as **few lines of codes as possible** and keep **the code as general as possible** so that it can be resued to solve analogue problems. Any improvement/suggestion are really appriciate.

If you are defenitely interested in this kind of riddles, I would also strongly encourage you, before looking at the solutitions, to first try to solve the problem on your side.
